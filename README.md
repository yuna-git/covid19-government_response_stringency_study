# covid19-government_response_stringency_study
It's been more than half a year now since people were aware of the first case of Covid-19, the entire world has the same goal: cases of Covid-19 need to go to zero. People are fighting back with all the measures we can think of, and after six months now everybody is wondering, are we making progress against the pandemic? Is any country doing better than others, and what can we learn from the experience? Here are some statistical data about the Covid-19 cases number, and also the goverment policies taken in different countries. The purpose of this project is to investigate whether the measures taken so far have helped to prevent the spreading of COVID-19, and how people can better protect themselves and families.
